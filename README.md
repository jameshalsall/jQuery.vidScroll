jQuery.vidScroll
================

Experimental jQuery plugin for controlling a video's scrubber positioning with the user's window scroll position.

This is currently in development, and I'm picking it up as and when I get some time to play around with it.

## Usage ##

Currently, there are no options available for the plugin and to use it you simply call:

    $('#idOfVideoElement').vidScroll();

You can see a full example in the [example/index.html](https://github.com/jameshalsall/jQuery.vidScroll/blob/master/example/index.html) file.

## Contributing ##

If you feel like you can improve this plugin in anyway (which you should, it's pretty shoddy right now), then just send
a new pull request and I'll take a look when I get chance.
